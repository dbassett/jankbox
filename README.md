# JANKBOX #
###########

What is a jankbox?  It's a janky web-based jukebox.

Seriously.  This thing is going to suck.  But I'm going to have fun working
on it.  So there.

I like BASH, so I'm probably going to use in inappropriately in all sorts of
places.  Additionally, I'll probably be writing a lot of PHP at $DAYJOB, so
this will be a place for me to brush up my skills.  Yeah, sure this would
probably be much better off written in node.js or python or ruby or whatever
it is that people who are fresh out of college and already make more than me
code in.  This isn't about writing the best jukebox, though.  It's about
writing the best /jankbox/.

I might put some JS in the frontend, though.  I do kind of want to learn some
of that.

The stark reality of this whole thing, however, is that I'm basically writing
this for myself.  Nobody else is going to use it, and that's fine.  I'm sure
there are already 8,000,000,000 much better web-based jukeboxes out there.
